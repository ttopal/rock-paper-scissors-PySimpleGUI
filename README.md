What Is PySimpleGUI ‚ùì
PySimpleGUI is a Python package that enables Python programmers of all levels to create GUIs.
You specify your GUI window using a "layout" which contains widgets (they're called "Elements" in PySimpleGUI).
Your layout is used to create a window using one of the 4 supported frameworks to display and interact with your window. 
Supported frameworks include tkinter, Qt, WxPython, or Remi. The term "wrapper" is sometimes used for these kinds of packages.
